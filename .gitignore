# This file describes files/directories we want
# git to ignore, i.e. never consider for version
# control.  If this is added after the fact, and
# we want to wipe any existing examples of such
# files from the repo and future versioning, do
# something like:
# git ls-files | grep -E '[.](~|swp|swo)$' | xargs git rm --cached 
# ... but for each pattern you are trying to wipe

# emacs and vim temp files
